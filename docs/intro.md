## Getting Started with JScripted

JScripted is an attempt at simplifying JavaScript concepts to the bare minimum to help developers ace their Frontend interviews.

### But why?

When I started out on my frontend development journey, I was at a loss of resources to prepare for my interviews. Be it machine coding rounds, JS QnA rounds or System Design rounds, I failed to find a platform having it all at one place, thus ended up bookmarking more than 30 websites :)
