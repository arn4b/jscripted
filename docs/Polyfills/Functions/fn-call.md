# Polyfills for Function Methods

There are three main Function.prototype methods that are widely used in JS - call, apply and bind.

:::tip DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CALL, APPLY AND BIND

|           |                           call()                           |                           apply()                          |                             bind()                             |

|  Returns  | Returns and calls the same function at the time of binding | Returns and calls the same function at the time of binding | Return a new.copied function, which can be used anytime later. |

## Fuction.prototype.call()

 The call() allows for a function/method belonging to one object to be assigned and called for a different object.

call() provides a new value of this to the function/method. With call(), you can write a method once and then inherit it in another object, without having to rewrite the method for the new object. 

:::caution
Note: While the syntax of this function is almost identical to that of apply(), the fundamental difference is that call() accepts an argument list, while apply() accepts a single array of arguments.

Lets understand call() using an example ðŸ‘‡

```js
function Product(name, price) {
  this.name = name;
  this.price = price;
}

function Food(name, price) {
  Product.call(this, name, price);
  this.category = 'food';
}

function Toy(name, price) {
  Product.call(this, name, price);
  this.category = 'toy';
}

const cheese = new Food('feta', 5);
const fun = new Toy('robot', 40);
```

For the polyfill, we will simply create a reference to the function, and pass the arguments to the function reference.

**Final polyfill for Function.prototype.call()**

```js
Function.prototype.myCall = function(obj, ...args) {
    obj.fnRef = this
    obj.fnRef(...args)
}
```

## Fuction.prototype.apply()

apply is very similar to call(), except for the type of arguments it supports. You use an arguments array instead of a list of arguments (parameters). With apply, you can also use an array literal, for example, func.apply(this, ['eat', 'bananas']), or an Array object, for example, func.apply(this, new Array('eat', 'bananas')).

The apply() method calls a function with a given this value, and arguments provided as an array (or an array-like object).

Lets understand apply() using an example ðŸ‘‡

```js
const numbers = [5, 6, 2, 3, 7];

const max = Math.max.apply(null, numbers);

console.log(max);
// expected output: 7

const min = Math.min.apply(null, numbers);

console.log(min);
// expected output: 2

```

Just like call(), we will simply create a reference to the function, and pass the arguments to the function reference. But in this case, we will not spread the arguments, as apply() accepts an array/array like object as the parameter.

**Final polyfill for Function.prototype.apply()**

```js
Function.prototype.myApply = function(obj, args) {
    obj.fnRef = this
    obj.fnRef(...args)
}
```

## Fuction.prototype.bind()

The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.

```js
Function.prototype.myBind = function(obj) {
    obj.fnRef = this
    return function(...args) {
        obj.fnRef(...args)
    }
}
```
